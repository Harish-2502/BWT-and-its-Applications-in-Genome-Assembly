# BWT-and-its-Applications-in-Genome-Assembly

The Burrows–Wheeler transform (BWT) rearranges a character string into 
runs of similar characters.

● The transformation is reversible, without needing to store any additional 
data except the position of the first original character.

● The BWT is an effective method of improving the efficiency of text 
compression algorithms, costing only some extra computation
